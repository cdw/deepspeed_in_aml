These notebooks show how to fine-tune an NLP model on AzureML. They are intended to be cloned to and executed on an [AzureML compute instance].

## Steps

- Clone this repo into an interactive session on a fresh AzureML compute instance 
- Install the `requirements.txt` into the local `AzureML_Py3.8` conda env via `conda activate azureml_py38 && pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Follow the notebooks in numerical order
